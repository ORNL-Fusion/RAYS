# solovev\_2_\eqdsk

A simple code to generate an eqdsk file from a solovev equilibrium.  It links to RAYS\_lib
uses the solovev\_magnetics routine there, and uses the same solovev\_magnetics\_list
namelist to define the equilibrium.  It also directly uses eqdsk\_utilities\_m to write
the eqdsk file.
