# math_functions\_lib

A static library containing modules and subroutines mathematical functions used in the
RAYS project.  These are gathered here to avoid a lot of external library dependencies.
The library is presently linked by the RAYS code and by post\_proces\_RAYS.  It should be
useable by any code through an appropriate interface module.
