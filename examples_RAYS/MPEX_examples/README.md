# RAYS example runs for MPEX
Runs of the RAYS code for ordinary mode propagation in MPX for preliminary investigation
of OXB ECH cases for MPXEX.  As of 8/2025 the RAYS code could calculate cold plasma wave
propagation in MPEX magnetic mirror geometry, and could calculate the conversion
coefficient of O-to-X mode at the plasma cut-off layer.  The code does not presently
relaunch the converted X-mode rays or follow them to the Bernstein mode conversion.  The
enclosed .pdf file (*Preliminary RAYS results for MPEX.pdf*) is a brief presentation
I gave on these results.  It includes general information about the run inputs.
