# Examples for ECH in simple slab geometry with cold plasma dispersion relation

These examples replicate the figures shown in \"Ray Tracing Near the Electron
Cyclotron Frequency with Application to EBT\" by

The plasma is stratified in x and uniform in y and z.

Cases 1 and 2 are for constant magnetic field and increasing density, with the plasma cutoff
located at x = 0.

Case 1 is extraordinary mode launched above the lower hybrid resonance. rays
with nz = 0.4, 0.5, 0.6.  The interesting behaviour of the three rays is explained in
the reference mentioned above.

Case 2 is ordinary mode launched below the plasma cutoff.  Again an explanation is 
given in the IEEE paper
